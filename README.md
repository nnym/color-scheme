[Color Schemer](https://nnym.github.io/color-schemer) is a web application that facilitates the design of programming color schemes.
It contains a CodeMirror editor that supports many languages and is prepopulated with sample code (currently only C++)
and a sidebar with responsive color parameters.
The font can be changed and Google Fonts is searched if the specified font is not found.
